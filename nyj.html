        Trevor talks about his childhood. We meet his strong and resilient mother named Patricia Noah who is also a very religious woman. Trevorâ€™s family never misses church. They attend three churches which are white church, mixed and black church.  In this chapter, it reminds me of my county back in the days, when we use to have white missionaries in our town. We would go for church service on sundays and on christmas services we would miss out our church to go get a lot of gifts, after attending a very short sweet service full of christmas carols.

            Trevor grew up in a family of mixed ethnicity. His father, Robert, was Swiss/German, while his mother was black. In their community, laws were enforced that prohibited sex between Europeans and natives. The penalty for breaking this law was five years in prison. In this chapter, we discuss the issue of skin color and ethnicity. In my county, we are all Africans, but for some reason, people with lighter skin tones are considered more beautiful than others. Even at weddings, brides will bleach their skin. The Bajun community is divided, with some identifying as Arabs while others identify as Swahilis, even though they are all Swahilis. The "Arab" Swahilis prefer to marry their cousins rather than mix with the "common" Swahilis. There are also internal conflicts in my county, where those who are not Bajuns and come from upcountry are perceived differently. The Bajuns, who consider themselves the owners of the county, believe that no one else deserves to live there except for them. These two chapters in the book "Born a Crime" relate to the situation in my county, where discrimination based on skin color and ethnicity is still an issue. However, progress is being made, and this discrimination is slowly coming to an end.
