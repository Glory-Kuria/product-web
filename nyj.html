           <b>BORN A CRIME <br>
           Chapter one: Run</b> <br><br>
            Trevor talks about his childhood. We meet his strong and resilient mother named Patricia Noah who is also a very religious woman. Trevor’s family never misses church. They attend three churches which are white church, mixed and black church. <br> In this chapter, it reminds me of my county back in the days, when we use to have white missionaries in our town. We would go for church service on sundays and on christmas services we would miss out our church to go get a lot of gifts,<br> after attending a very short sweet service full of christmas carols.

            <b> two: Born a crime</b> <br><br>
            Trevor was raised in a mixed family. His father Robert was Swiss/German while mother was black. <br> They had enforced laws that sex between Europeans and natives was prohibited and if broken the penalty was five years in Prison. <br> Under apartheid, black men worked on the farm or factory or the mines while black women worked in a factory or as a maid. <br> <br>

Well, in this chapter, when we talk of blacks and whites, <br> In my county we are all africans but for some reasons, light skinned people are perceived to be more beautiful than the rest, even in weddings, <br> the bride will prefer bleach their skin. We have the bajun community and in them they are divided, others identify as arabs while others identify just as swahilis. <br><br> Even though they are all sahilis. So the ‘Arabs’ swahili, dont like geting married to the ‘common’ swahilis, They rather marry their cousins than mix .In my county we also have internal crisis , if you are from the upcountries and not a bajun, you are oerseived in another way. <br> The bajun who believe to be the owner of the county dont think any other person deserve to live there, except for them. <br> The book born a crime in these two chapters  relates to the situation back in My county. When it comes to the discrimination of color and tribe. But it is coming to an end in my county day by day.
