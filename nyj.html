            BORN A CRIME
            Chapter one: Run
            Trevor talks about his childhood. We meet his strong and resilient mother named Patricia Noah who is also a very religious woman. Trevor’s family never misses church. They attend three churches which are white church, mixed and black church. He grew up in a home with little exposure. They lived in Eden park, a tiny suburb way outside Johannesburg. Trevor describes how everything always went wrong because of his mother’s second hand car.Trevor attended a private Catholic school called Maryvale where he used to do well in sports. Trevor and his mother had a Tom and Jerry relationship. The mother was a disciplinarian while he was naughty. Nelson Mandela was released from prison when Trevor was nearly six years old. One sunday they had to go to church using a bus since his mother’s old volkswagen car broke down. They waited for a bus for a long time and they finally started walking. After walking for a long time a driver offered them a ride. A bus appeared when they had not even gone ten feet. A Zulu driver from the bus stopped them and forced them to enter the bus. There is a comparison between Zulu women who are known to be well mannered and dutiful while Xhosa women are known to be promiscuous and unfaithful. The driver started spedding off after telling Trevor’s mother that she would learn a lesson tonight. When the car slowed down on the next traffic light Trevor’s mother throws him out of the bus and then jumps with baby Andrew. His mother tells him to run as the men stopped the minibus and started chasing after them. They finally reached a petrol station and called the police who took them home.

            Trevor was raised in a mixed family. His father Robert was Swiss/German while mother was black. The had enforced laws that sex between Europeans and natives was prohibited and if broken the penalty was five years in Prison. Under apartheid, black men worked on the farm or factory or the mines while black women worked in a factory or as a maid. Trevor’s mother was a rebel and had done a secretarial course where got a white collar job. At the age of twenty two she ran away from home to live in downtown Johannesburg where black people were not permitted to live there. She learnt how to navigate the city from Xhosa women who were mostly prostitutes. They taught her how to dress up like a maid and introduced her to two white men who were willing to rent out flats in town. Patriciah’s flat was in Hillbrow. Down the corridor lived Trevor’s father  in 206. Patriciah spent a lot with someone who she could trust and felt safe with who was Robert. He was forty six while she was twenty four. The two had a genuine bond. Patriciah opened up about wanting a child but Robert refused at first and later on he agreed. Nine months later on February 20, 1984 Trevor was born. Trevor could only see his father when they are indoors. They never walked together outside. A mixed lady called Queen would be invited every time they wanted to go to the park. After three years Patriciah goes to see her family with Trevor in Soweto. His grandmother never allowed him to go play outside with his cousins. One day Trevor dug a hole under the gate and ran off. He never had friends and got used to being alone. Later on Trevor learns that there were alot of mixed children who are the same age as him and their parents smuggled them through Lesotho or Botswana and they grew up in England or Germany or Switzerland
